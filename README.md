```lua
local AIMBOT_ENABLED = true
local TEAM_CHECK = false -- If set to true then the script would only lock your aim at enemy team members.
local AIM_PART = "Head" -- Where the aimbot script would lock at.
local SENSITIVITY = 0 -- How many seconds it takes for the aimbot script to officially lock onto the target's aimpart.
